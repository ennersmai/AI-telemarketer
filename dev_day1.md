# Development Plan - Day 1: Accelerated Nova2 Exploration and Integration Foundation

**Goal for Today:** Achieve comprehensive awareness of Nova2's capabilities, set up essential API cloud keys, test the basic framework for conversational flow and scripting, and establish the foundational WebSockets and APIs for future Twilio and dashboard integrations.

**Tasks:**

1.  **Comprehensive Awareness of Nova2 Capabilities:**
    * **Objective:** To gain a broad and deep understanding of all the core functionalities offered by Nova2.
    * **Action:** Systematically explore the full range of Nova2 examples and documentation.
    * **Details:**
        * Review and experiment with examples covering:
            * Basic inference using `Conversation` and `Message` objects.
            * Advanced management of the `Conversation` object (adding, deleting, retrieving messages).
            * The Context System: creating, adding, modifying, and utilizing `ContextDatapoint` objects from various sources.
            * Memory management features (if applicable in Nova2).
            * Integration with external Tools.
            * Any other relevant modules or functionalities provided by Nova2.
        * For each functionality, actively modify the code, observe the output, and think about how it can be applied to the AI Telemarketer project. Aim to develop a solid mental model of Nova2's architecture and capabilities.

2.  **Setup of Essential API Cloud Keys:**
    * **Objective:** To configure access to necessary cloud-based services.
    * **Action:** Identify and securely set up API keys for the following services:
        * ElevenLabs (for TTS).
        * OpenAI (for LLM, unless you're planning to use a local model initially).
        * Groq (potentially for LLM as well).
        * Qdrant Cloud (if you decide to use a cloud-based vector database; otherwise, acknowledge that it will run locally).
        * Twilio (for telephony integration, even though the full integration comes on Dev Day 2).
    * **Details:**
        * Obtain the API keys from the respective service providers.
        * Store these keys securely, preferably using environment variables within your Cursor IDE or through a `.env` file that is not committed to version control.
        * Perform a basic authentication test with each service if possible to ensure the keys are working correctly.
        * Explicitly note that API keys or configurations for local STT, the local database, and local embeddings will be handled separately or are already in place.

3.  **Testing Basic Nova2 Framework and Script Integration:**
    * **Objective:** To understand how to manage conversational flows and integrate scripts within Nova2.
    * **Action:** Experiment with creating basic conversation flows based on the initial stages of your telemarketing script.
    * **Details:**
        * Initialize Nova and a basic LLM configuration.
        * Create `Conversation` objects and add initial system messages to define the agent's persona and objectives.
        * Implement the greeting and the introduction of Proactiv Privileges as initial assistant messages.
        * Simulate various user responses and observe how the LLM responds based on the initial script and the simulated input.
        * Experiment with using the `Context` to store and retrieve information relevant to the conversation (e.g., lead's name, simulated interest level) and observe how this influences the LLM's responses and guides the conversation flow.
        * Explore basic branching logic within the conversation based on context or user input.

4.  **Foundation for Twilio and Dashboard Integrations:**
    * **Objective:** To create the initial communication channels required for integration with Twilio and a future dashboard.
    * **Action:** Design and implement the basic structure for WebSocket and API endpoints.
    * **Details:**
        * **WebSockets:** Set up the foundation for WebSocket endpoints that can be used to expose metrics, configuration parameters, and potentially real-time event streams for both Twilio and the dashboard. This might involve defining the basic routing and message handling structure using a library like `websockets` or a framework like FastAPI that supports WebSockets. The actual implementation of data being sent and received can come on Dev Day 2.
        * **APIs:** Create the basic structure for API endpoints (potentially using Flask or FastAPI) that can be used by `twilio_manager.py` to signal call initiation, send metadata, and receive status updates. Also, consider API endpoints that the dashboard might use to retrieve metrics or manage configurations. Focus on defining the API routes and basic request/response structures.
        * The goal is to have the communication infrastructure ready so that on Dev Day 2, you can focus on the actual integration logic and UI development.

**End of Day 1 Goal:** By the end of today, we should have a comprehensive understanding of Nova2's core functionalities, have the necessary cloud API keys configured, have tested the basic conversational framework and script integration capabilities of Nova2, and have laid the groundwork by creating the initial WebSocket and API structures for our Twilio and dashboard integrations. This will set us up for focused integration work on Dev Day 2.
